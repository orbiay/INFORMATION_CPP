***************************************************Constructors********************************************

**A constructor in C++ is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.**
**It is always public, and it does not have any return value.**
**To create a constructor, use the same name as the class, followed by parentheses ()**

EXAMPLE : 
		class MyClass {     // The class
		  public:           // Access specifier
		    MyClass() {     // Constructor
		      cout << "Hello World!";
		    }
		}

		int main() {
		  MyClass myObj;    // Create an object of MyClass (this will call the constructor)
		  return 0;
		}

***********************************************Types of Constructors :**************************************************

1. **Default Constructors: Default constructor is the constructor which doesn’t take any argument. It has no parameters. It is also called a zero-argument constructor.**
**Note: Even if we do not define any constructor explicitly, the compiler will automatically provide a default constructor implicitly.**

2. **Parameterized Constructors: It is possible to pass arguments to constructors. Typically, these arguments help initialize an object when it is created.**
 **To create a parameterized constructor, simply add parameters to it the way you would to any other function. When you define the constructor’s body, use the parameters to initialize the object.**

3. **A copy constructor is a member function that initializes an object using another object of the same class. A detailed article on Copy Constructor.**

Whenever we define one or more non-default constructors( with parameters ) for a class, a default constructor( without parameters ) should also be explicitly defined as the compiler will not provide a default constructor in this case.**
 **However, it is not necessary but it’s considered to be the best practice to always define a default constructor.**

**Copy constructor takes a reference to an object of the same class as an argument.**

4. Assignment operator : is a member function that initializes an object using another object of the same class
,This operator is called when an already initialized object is assigned a new value from another existing object.
