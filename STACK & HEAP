********************************STACK**************************************************

**Everytime a function is called, the machine allocates some stack memory for it.**
 **When a new local variables is declared,**
  **more stack memory is allocated for that function to store the variable.**
 **After the function returns, the stack memory of this function is deallocated, which means all local variables become invalid.**
 **The allocation and deallocation for stack memory is automatically done.**

*****************************HEAP******************************************************

 **heap memory is allocated explicitly by programmers and it wonâ€™t be deallocated until it is explicitly freed.**
 **To allocate heap memory in C++, use the keyword new followed by the constructor of what you want to allocate.**
   **The return value of new operator will be the address of what you just created (which points to somewhere in the heap).**
